This project was bootstrapped with (https://github.com/expo/examples/tree/master/with-typescript). I have used these packages:

Please follow the given link for expo command line setup (https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

Please follow the given link to setup Expo Go (https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/expo-go/)

The project works with NodeJS 18 and above. Please make sure through your node versioning system you are using NodeJS 18 and above. Please use simulator as we are using a simple JSON server. Currently JSON server running cannot communicate with Android virtual device.

Android virutal device not connecting to json-server is a known issue. Tried this solution (https://dsinecos.github.io/blog/How-to-call-a-locally-hosted-server-from-expo-app) but it fails to work with Expo SDK 50.
